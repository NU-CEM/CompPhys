            "content": "To participate in this course you will need access to the following software: Python, Bash, Git and Jupyter. To install this software on your personal laptop or desktop carefully follow the instructions listed below. . You will also need a user account at github.com - Basic GitHub accounts are free. . . All of the software needed for this course is pre-installed in the MPEE computers at Northumbria University . You can also run the Python Jupyter Notebook files remotely through the [binder] or [colab] services whenever you see an icon (e.g. like those at the top of [this page]()). But be warned! Any changes you make are not saved and the service can time-out after a period of inactivity (usually ~20 minutes). Python . [Python][python] is a popular language for scientific computing, and great for general-purpose programming as well. Installing all of its scientific packages individually can be a bit difficult, however, so we recommend the all-in-one installer [Anaconda][anaconda]. Please make sure you install Python version 3.x (e.g., 3.4 is fine). . Windows - [Video tutorial] . Open [https://www.anaconda.com/download] with your web browser. . | Download the Python 3 installer for Windows. . | Double-click the executable and install Python 3 using MOST of the default settings, the only exception is to check Add Anaconda to my PATH environment variable. . | Mac OS X - [Video tutorial] . Open [https://www.anaconda.com/download] with your web browser. . | Download the Python 3 installer for OS X. . | Install Python 3 using all of the defaults for installation. . | Bash and Git . Bash is a commonly-used shell that gives you the power to do simple tasks more quickly. Git is version-control software that allows to you to develop code more efficiently and share a public version of your code on github.com. In fact, this website is built using Bash, Git and github.com (amongst other tools) - the code can be found here. You can download both tools at the same time following the instructions below. . Windows - video tutorial . Download the Git for Windows installer . | Run the installer and follow the steps below: . a) Click on “Next” four times (two times if you’ve previously installed Git). You don’t need to change anything in the Information, location, components, and start menu screens. . b) Select “Use the nano editor by default” and click on “Next”. . c) Keep “Use Git from the command line and…” selected and click on “Next”. If you forgot to do this programs that you need for the workshop will not work properly. If this happens rerun the installer and select the appropriate option. . d) Click on “Next” . e) Keep “Checkout Windows-style, commit Unix-style line endings” selected and click on “Next”. . f) Select “Use Windows’ default console window” and click on “Next”. . g) Ensure that “Default (fast-forward or merge) is selected and click “Next” . h) Ensure that “Git Credential Manager Core” is selected and click on “Next”. . i) Ensure that “Enable file system caching” is selected and click on “Next”. . j) Click on “Install” . k) Click on “Finish” . | If your “HOME” environment variable is not set (or you don’t know what this is): . a) Open command prompt (Open Start Menu then type cmd and press [Enter]) . b) Type the following line into the command prompt window exactly as shown: setx HOME &quot;%USERPROFILE%&quot; . c) Press [Enter], you should see SUCCESS: Specified value was saved. . | d) Quit command prompt by typing exit then pressing [Enter] . This will provide you with both Git and Bash in the Git Bash program. . macOS . For macOS, install Git for Mac by downloading and running the most recent “mavericks” installer from this list. Because this installer is not signed by the developer, you may have to right click (control click) on the .pkg file, click Open, and click Open on the pop up window. After installing Git, there will not be anything in your /Applications folder, as Git is a command line program. For older versions of OS X (10.5-10.8) use the most recent available installer labelled “snow-leopard” available here. . See the Git installation video tutorial for an example on how to open the Terminal. . Jupyter . We will teach Python using the [Jupyter notebook][jupyter], a programming environment that runs in a web browser. Jupyter requires a reasonably up-to-date browser, preferably a current version of Chrome, Safari, or Firefox (note that Internet Explorer version 9 and below are not supported). Jupyter was installed as part of the Anaconda package for Python. . Launch a Jupyter Notebook . To check that this software has installed correctly, open Git bash (or terminal) and type the command: . $ jupyter notebook . You should launch the Jupyter Notebook in the folder where you want to save your notebook files. You can find this folder using the Unix commands cd (change directory) and pwd (print working directory). We will learn more about these commands in a the lesson Python scripts and the Unix terminal . You should see a file browser pop up as a new tab on your browser. Select new and you should see Python 3 listed as an option. Clicking on this will create a new Python 3 notebook file. . Start the command line Python interpreter . To start the Python interpreter without the notebook, you can open a terminal or Git Bash and type the command: . $ python .",

Computational physics encompasses a wide number of areas including materials modelling, particle physics simulations, protein structure prediction and plasma modelling. In fact, it is possible to find a computational branch for every major field in physics. . The focus of this course is to equip with you with the transferable skills needed for success in a range of computational disciplines, with examples tailored towards the physics domain. . This course is split into three sections - Getting started, Getting results and Getting it out there. In the first part of the course, Getting started, we will introduce programming concepts and Python libraries that are applicable to a wide range of research and industry - from game design to architecture. In the middle section of the course, which is called Getting results, we will apply these tools to model the differential equations that are so central to both classical and quantum physics. In the final section of the course, Getting it out there, we will use modern software engineering techniques to document, test and share our code. . How does this course relate to experimental physics? . The first part of this course covers the basic skills needed for processing experimental data using Python. At the end of Getting started you will be able to read in experimental data from a plain text file, clean the data, apply basic statistical analysis and plot. We very much encourage you to apply the tools outlined in this course to your experimental analysis. .",

In Python 3, the // operator performs integer (whole-number) floor division, the / operator performs floating-point division, and the ‘%’ (or modulo) operator calculates and returns the remainder from integer division: . print(&#39;5 // 3:&#39;, 5//3) print(&#39;5 / 3:&#39;, 5/3) print(&#39;5 % 3:&#39;, 5%3) . 5 // 3: 1 5 / 3: 1.6666666666666667 5 % 3: 2 . However in Python 2 (and other languages), the / operator between two integer types perform a floor (//) division. To perform a float division, we have to convert one of the integers to float. . print(&#39;5 // 3:&#39;, 1) print(&#39;5 / 3:&#39;, 1 ) print(&#39;5 / float(3):&#39;, 1.6666667 ) print(&#39;float(5) / 3:&#39;, 1.6666667 ) print(&#39;float(5 / 3):&#39;, 1.0 ) print(&#39;5 % 3:&#39;, 2) .

Python has a built-in function called print that prints things as text. | Call the function (i.e., tell Python to run it) by using its name. | Provide values to the function (i.e., the things to print) in parentheses. | To add a string to the printout, wrap the string in single or double quotes. | The values passed to the function are called &#39;arguments&#39; | . print(first_name, &#39;is&#39;, age, &#39;years old&#39;) .

The last line of an error message is usually the most informative. | We will look at error messages in detail later. | . Variables Persist Between Cells . Be aware that it is the order of execution of cells that is important in a Jupyter notebook, not the order in which they appear. Python will remember all the code that was run previously, including any variables you have defined, irrespective of the order in the notebook. Therefore if you define variables lower down the notebook and then (re)run cells further up, those defined further down will still be present. As an example, we can create 2 cells with the following content, in this order: . print(myval) . myval = 1 . If you execute this in order, the first cell will give an error. However, if you run the first cell after the second cell it will print out ‘1’. To prevent confusion, it can be helpful to use the Kernel -&gt; Restart &amp; Run All option which clears the interpreter and runs everything from a clean slate going top to bottom. .

Age in three years: 45 . Python is case-sensitive. . Python thinks that upper- and lower-case letters are different, so Name and name are different variables. | There are conventions for using upper-case letters at the start of variable names so we will use lower-case letters for now. | . . Tip: In programming an eye for detail is important. If you include an extra full-stop, or forget a space, then you may get an error message or unexpected behaviour. . Use valid and meaningful variable names. . Python doesn&#39;t care what you call variables as long as they obey the following rules: . can only contain letters, digits, and underscore _ (typically used to separate words in long variable names) | cannot start with a digit | . | Variable names that start with underscores like __bobbins_real_age have a special meaning so we won&#39;t do that until we understand the convention. . | . flabadab = 42 ewr_422_yY = &#39;Ahmed&#39; print(ewr_422_yY, &#39;is&#39;, flabadab, &#39;years old&#39;) .

What is the final value of position in the program below? (Try to predict the value without running the program, then check your prediction.) . initial = &#39;left&#39; position = initial initial = &#39;right&#39; . Show answer The final value of position is &#39;left&#39;. . The initial variable is assigned the value ‘left’. In the second line, the position variable also receives the string value ‘left’. In third line, the initial variable is given the value ‘right’, but the position variable retains its string value of ‘left’. . Choosing a Name . Which is a better variable name, m, min, or minutes? Why? . Hint: think about which code you would rather inherit from someone who is leaving the lab: . ts = m * 60 + s tot_sec = min * 60 + sec total_seconds = minutes * 60 + seconds . Show answer minutes is better because min might mean something like “minimum” (and actually does in Python, but we haven’t seen that yet). . . See the notebook. .

Computing has become central to virtually all research and development in academia and industry, 
and with the advent of Machine Learning and High-Performance Computing this dominance is set to continue.

Computational physics encompasses a wide number of areas including materials modelling, particle physics simulations, protein structure prediction and plasma modelling. In fact, it is possible to find a computational branch for every major field in physics.

**The focus of this course is to equip with you with the transferable skills needed for success in a range of computational disciplines, with examples tailored towards the physics domain.**

This course is split into three sections - *Getting started*, *Getting results* and *Getting it out there*.
In the first part of the course, *Getting started*, we will introduce programming concepts and Python libraries that are applicable to a wide range of research and industry - from game design to architecture. In the middle section of the course, which is called *Getting results*, we will apply these tools to model the differential equations that are so central to both classical and quantum physics. In the final section of the course, *Getting it out there*, we will use modern software engineering techniques to document, test and share our code.

In the final section of the course you will also hear from **three guest speakers** who use some of the computational skills outlined in this course in their own work. In 2021 the guest speakers are: Anna Krystalli (Research Software Engineer, Sheffield University), Adam Jackson (Computational scientist, Science and Technology Facilities Council), Felix Rehren (Director of insurance mergers and acquisitions, Athora).

### How does this course relate to experimental physics?

The first part of this course covers the basic skills needed for processing experimental data using Python. At the end of *Getting started* you will be able to read in experimental data from a plain text file, clean the data, apply basic statistical analysis and plot. **We very much encourage you to apply the tools outlined in this course to your experimental analysis.**

### Do I need to attend the in-person labs?

I will aim to publish all course materials on this website **however** a large component of this course is based around verbal explanations whilst writing code and class discussion. It will all make *much more sense* if you attend the sessions in the computer lab! 

The details for Autumn 2021 are:
- Wednesdays 9-12am 
- Room D211 in Ellison building

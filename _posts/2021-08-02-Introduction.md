Computing has become central to virtually all research and development in academia and industry, 
and with the advent of Machine Learning and High-Performance Computing this dominance is set to continue.

Computational physics encompasses a wide number of areas including materials modelling, particle physics simulations, protein structure prediction and plasma modelling. In fact, it is possible to find a computational branch for every major field in physics.

**The focus of this course is to equip with you with the transferable skills needed for success in a range of computational disciplines, with examples tailored towards the physics domain.**

This course is split into three sections - *Getting started*, *Getting results* and *Getting it out there*.
In the first part of the course, *Getting started*, we will recap the basic programming concepts and Python libraries that are applicable to a wide range of research and industry - from game design to architecture. In the middle section of the course, which is called *Getting results*, we will combine these tools with numerical methods to model the differential equations that are so central to both classical and quantum physics. In the final section of the course, *Getting it out there*, we will use modern software engineering techniques to document, test and share our code.

### How does this course relate to experimental physics?

The first part of this course recaps the basic skills needed for processing experimental data using Python. At the end of *Getting started* you will be able to read in experimental data from a plain text file, clean the data, apply basic statistical analysis and plot. **We very much encourage you to apply the tools outlined in this course to your experimental analysis.**

### Do I need to attend the in-person labs?

I will aim to publish all course materials on this website **however** a large component of this course is based on the verbal explanations whilst writing code (a.k.a, "live coding") and class discussion. It will all make *much more sense* if you attend the sessions in the computer lab.

### Why do you use a Github website?

Blackboard collaborate is widely used at Northumbria University for teaching. However in the computational sciences (and in software engineering) Blackboard collaborate *is not* widely used. The aim here is to teach and learn using the tools that are already used in research and industry - hence building the course resources around the [Github](https://github.com) service. Also, the code can be nicely formatted using Markdown/html (rather than blackboard), making it easier for students to read and understand.

The source code for this website can be found in the [course Github repository](https://github.com/nu-cem/CompPhys).
If you spot any mistakes or would like to make a suggestions for improving the course please [raise an issue on Github](https://github.com/nu-cem/CompPhys/issues).

Blackboard collaborate will be used for posting assessments and for course announcements.

## Boundary conditions

In [the tutorial](https://nu-cem.github.io/CompPhys/2021/08/02/Finite-Difference) we implement the finite difference method with fixed boundary conditions - this is an example of [Dirichlet-type boundary conditions](https://math.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Differential_Equations/Book%3A_Partial_Differential_Equations_(Walet)/03%3A_Boundary_and_Initial_Conditions/3.02%3A_Explicit_Boundary_Conditions). 

~~~python
def finite_difference(phi):

    for i in range(grid_height): # for each grid point
        for j in range(grid_width):
            if i==0 or i==grid_height-1 or j==0 or j==grid_width-1:
                phi_prime[i,j] = phi[i,j] # if at boundary, keep fixed
            else: # otherwise apply finite difference
                phi_prime[i,j] = (phi[i+1,j]+phi[i-1,j]+phi[i,j+1]+phi[i,j-1]) / 4
    
    return phi_prime
~~~

Another form of boundary condition is a Periodic Boundary Condition. PBCs are often chosen for approximating a large (infinite) system by using a small part called a unit cell, and are most famously used for modelling periodic crystals in solid state physics. Mathematically, PBCs can be expressed for $f(x,y)$ on a two dimensional $N \times N$ grid as:

\begin{equation}
f[N+1,y] = f[0,y],
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
f[x,N+1] = f[x,0],
\end{equation}

Write a function which calculates the finite difference with periodic boundary conditions

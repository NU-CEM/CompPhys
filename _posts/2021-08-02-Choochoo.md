A pre-requisite for this course is a basic understanding of Python. 
If you need to recap on the basics, you can use the [Python for Physicists website](https://lucydot.github.io/python_novice/) - this covers all of the pre-requisite knowledge needed.

To self-assess your level of understanding, we recommend using ChooChoo the Checklist tool. 
Your course instructor will need to setup a ChooChoo repository and send you the link. Student instructions for using ChooChoo can be found [here](https://lucydot.github.io/ChooChoo/students/setup/).

This lesson is an introduction to programming in Python for people with little or no previous programming experience. It uses plotting UV-Vis data as its motivating example. This lesson references the Jupyter Notebook, but can be followed using a regular Python interpreter as well. Please note that this lesson, like all others in the course, uses Python 3 rather than Python 2.

### Before you begin

- Check that Python is installed: please see the setup instructions for details.
- Download the UV-Vis data: [UVVis-01.csv]()
- Launch a Jupyter notebook: open Git Bash (Windows) or a terminal (Mac) and type `jupyter notebook`

> Tip: You should launch the Jupyter Notebook in the folder where you want to save your notebook files. You can find this folder using the Unix commands `cd` (change directory) and `pwd` (print working directory). We will learn more about Unix later in the course.

This lesson is part one of an introduction to programming in Python for people with little or no previous programming experience.  This lesson references the Jupyter Notebook, but can be followed using a regular Python interpreter as well. Please note that this lesson, like all others in the course, uses Python 3 rather than Python 2.

### Before you begin

- Check that Python and Jupyter Notebook are installed
- Launch a Jupyter notebook 

Please see the [Setup](https://nu-cem.github.io/CompPhys/2021/08/02/Setup) page for more details.

## Pandas or Numpy

Pandas and [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) are both essential libraries for scientific computation due to their intuitive syntax and high-performance matrix computation capabilities. In which contexts might Pandas be a more useful library than Numpy (and vice-verca)?

- The Pandas module works well with tabular data. Pandas provides 2d table object called DataFrame.
- The NumPy module works well with numerical data. NumPy provides a multi-dimensional array, well suited to matrix operations.
- If memory is a limiting factor, NumPy typically consumes less memory than Pandas.

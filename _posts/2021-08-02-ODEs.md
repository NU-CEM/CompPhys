Broadly speaking, there are three ways to solve a differential equation: analytically, numerically (with a pre-existing function) or numerically (with a home-made function). Numerical approaches offer more flexibility but with the caveat that they are approximate and must be converged. 

In this lesson we will use numerical approaches to solve ODE's, but with a strong focus on home-made numerical functions, so that a greater understanding of the approximations and approaches (and a good chance to practice Python skills).

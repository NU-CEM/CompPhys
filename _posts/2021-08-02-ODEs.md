In this section of the course we will learn how to solve ordinary differential equations. These are of vital importance to a physicist as they are at the base of classical and celestial mechanics via Newton's equations. They are also used to model electrical circuits and radioactive decay, amongst other systems.
 
Broadly speaking, there are three ways to solve a differential equation: analytically, numerically (with a pre-existing function) or numerically (with a home-made function). Numerical approaches offer more flexibility but with the caveat that they are approximate and must be converged. 

In this lesson we will use numerical approaches to solve ODE's, but with a strong focus on home-made numerical functions, so that a greater understanding of the approximations and approaches (and a good chance to practice Python skills).

There are no quick test questions - can you think of a good one? Then suggest it [here](https://github.com/NU-CEM/CompPhys/issues).

You can practice the Runge Kutta method in the [exercises](https://nu-cem.github.io/CompPhys/2021/08/02/ODE_exercises) and [extension exercises](https://nu-cem.github.io/CompPhys/2021/08/02/ODE_extension).

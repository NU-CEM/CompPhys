    "We now have  not  just one solution, but a whole  class  of solutions that are dependent on the initial amount of radioactive material $N_0$. To model  a physical system, this initial value (also known as initial condition) has to be provided alongside the constant of proportionality $\\lambda$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The number of  initial conditions depends on the order of  the differential equation\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that as this is a first-order ODE we only had to provide a single  initial condition. For second-order  ODEs  we would  need to provide two initial conditions, for third-order ODEs we would  need to provide three, and so on.\n",

    <p>Computing has become central to virtually all research and development in academia and industry, 
and with the advent of Machine Learning and High-Performance Computing this dominance is set to continue.</p>

<p>Computational physics encompasses a wide number of areas including materials modelling, particle physics simulations, protein structure prediction and plasma modelling. In fact, it is possible to find a computational branch for every major field in physics.</p>

<p><strong>The focus of this course is to equip with you with knowledge and skills needed to model a range of physical systems using numerical methods. You will also gain a number of transferable skills which can be applied across in a range of computational disciplines.</strong></p>

<p>This course is split into three sections - <em>Getting started</em>, <em>Getting results</em> and <em>Getting it out there</em>.
In the first part of the course, <em>Getting started</em>, we will recap the basic programming concepts and Python libraries that are applicable to a wide range of research and industry. In the middle section of the course, which is called <em>Getting results</em>, we will combine our Python knowledge with mathematical numerical methods to model various physical systems using differential equations. In the final section of the course, <em>Getting it out there</em>, we will use modern software engineering techniques to document, test and share our code.</p>

<h3 id="how-does-this-course-relate-to-experimental-physics">How does this course relate to experimental physics?</h3>

<p>The first part of this course recaps the basic skills needed for processing experimental data using Python. At the end of <em>Getting started</em> you will be able to read in experimental data from a plain text file, clean the data, apply basic statistical analysis and plot. <strong>We very much encourage you to apply the tools outlined in this course to your experimental analysis.</strong></p>

<h3 id="do-i-need-to-attend-the-in-person-labs">Do I need to attend the in-person labs?</h3>

<p>We will aim to publish all course materials on this website <strong>however</strong> a large component of this course is based on the verbal explanations whilst writing code (a.k.a, “live coding”) and class discussion. It will all make <em>much more sense</em> if you attend the sessions in the computer lab. The computer labs will not be recorded.</p>

<h3 id="why-do-you-use-a-github-website">Why do you use a Github website?</h3>

<p>Blackboard collaborate is widely used at Northumbria University for teaching. However in the computational sciences (and in software engineering) Blackboard collaborate <em>is not</em> widely used. The aim here is to teach and learn using the tools that are already used in research and industry - hence building the course resources around the <a href="https://github.com">Github</a> service. Also, the code can be nicely formatted using Markdown/html (rather than blackboard), making it easier for students to read and understand.</p>

<p>The source code for this website can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/nu-cem/CompPhys">course Github repository</a>.
If you spot any mistakes or would like to make a suggestions for improving the course please <a href="https://github.com/nu-cem/CompPhys/issues">raise an issue on Github</a>.</p>

<p>Blackboard collaborate will be used for posting assessments and for course announcements.</p>
